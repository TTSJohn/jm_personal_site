<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Writing about yourself can be one of the hardest tasks a person can take on. Where do I begin? Let's start with this, driven and motivated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have always been a hard worker, any employer, manager, or colleague can tell you that. You will even see that for yourself. Which puts a lot of emphassis on this next statement. I decided to take 2017 and beyond to the next level. I worked on my drive and motivation. I started exercising more, taking on a personal trainer. I started eating healthier than ever, which has increased my energy and abilties. Most importantly, I focused on where to go with my career. I started 2017 with a task I was, believe it or not, extremely excited for. I started 2017 with research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I knew Ad Operations wasn't the end for me, it was another step. I looked at all options, do I move back to sales? Do I look for a blended role of Operations and Marketing? Do I go back to school? I always had an interest in technology but I was in that generation that came just before computer science took off, we didn't even have an internet connection in my apartment my senior year of college, we saved our papers on disks and printed them out at the computer center. I thought I had missed my chance. Until now. I started looking at my options and came across coding schools so I took my research even deeper. I looked up the different coding schools, I read reviews, I even spoke to the boyfriend of a colleague who had recently completed a course himself. Finally, I started speaking to the schools. I spoke with several different options but I truly felt like Tech Talent South was the right fit for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I dove right into the course. I went over the pre-work. I did the reading. I was ready to go day 1 and I jumped right in. I've enjoyed my introduction to coding. I like the challenges, I like the feeling of accomplishment when I solve a roadblock. I know I made the right decision. The hard work is starting to pay off and it is showing. Now I am looking for the right fit, the right company to move forward with my career.</p>
