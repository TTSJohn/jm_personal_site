<h1>Success Stories</h1>
<p>My career has been defined by hard work and responsibility. I would like to highlight some achievements throughout each stage of my career.</p>
<p>InflectionPointMedia provided the best opportunity for growth so far in my career. I had the ability to step up and create business growth instead of being a task-taker. Through prospecting, I found a company that provided voter data and tendencies. I opened a dialogue with this company, saw the opportunity, then presented it to our CEO. Our CEO recognized the potential of the data that this company had and immediately jumped onboard. The deal was closed for a partnership which provided InflectionPointMedia additional data that was leveraged in proposals that won us more business. This was a prospecting task I took up on my own without being prompted. I appreciated this opportunity because it gave me a chance to show my ability on how I can be an asset to my company.</p>
<p>Another success story from InflectionPointMedia was my ability to work across departments. InflectionPointMedia was a startup and employees pitched in wherever they could. I volunteered for any project or task I could as a way to understand the business better than I currently did. I worked with clients, handling the responsibility of fixing any issues that arose or being proactive and looking for improvements on advertising campaigns that were already running. I volunteered to take on invoicing for the client that eventually became 100% my responsibility. I would take on special tasks for both our CEO and CFO. I even managed some IT troubleshooting. InflectionPointMedia was a place of growth for me and was an enviroment that provided me the chance to show what a valuable employee I could be.</p>
<p>CDW is a technology reseller. I learned many technical skills and understanding of technology through CDW. I consistently met my sales goals and improved my client management skills but most importantly, I took up every opportunity to learn. I never missed a product demo and always took time to speak with vendors to learns the benefits of their products. From a personal standpoint, there was a lot of value in CDW because it renewed my interest in technology which has continued to grow the more I learn.</p>
<p>Going back farther in my career, I would like to point out two more success stories. First would be my time at Jupitermedia. Jupitermedia provided my first experience in the business world. The most important takeaway from Jupitermedia was my networking connections. To this day, I still have and leverage connections I made at Jupitermedia. I currently provide Ad Operations contract work for a website owned and operated by the former Founder and CEO of Jupitermedia. I was recommended for this contract work by a former coworker at Jupitermedia who is aware of my work ethic and knew that I could be a reliable contractor. The second success story I would like to point out is my time as a Buildings and Grounds Coordinator at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport. This position was mainly a handyman who could handle any task given. Some days it was carpentry, other days painting, landscaping, or other duties. I worked at the Diocese of Bridgeport on breaks from college. During my third summer break, I took over as the foreman of the landscaping crew. I would plan our jobs for the week, track our hours and what we did at each property, and mete out responsibilites for the crew. As a college student working part time on breaks, I was already trusted enough to handle a crew and the responsibilities that came with it. I think this is an excellent example of my career trajectory so far.</p>
